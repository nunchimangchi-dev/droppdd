# Handoff: droppdd App Shell

The `droppdd` app shell is complete, featuring persistent navigation, a dashboard, workout tracker, meals section, and progress tracking.

## Pages Built
- **Dashboard (`/`)**: Today's snapshot (OMAD status, streak, weight trend), WOD card, upcoming meal card.
- **Workouts (`/workouts`)**: List of guided workouts. Detail page (`/workouts/[id]`) with an interactive `WorkoutTracker` including set-completion tracking and rest timer.
- **Meals (`/meals`)**: Mock meal ideas with nutrition info and preparation protocols. Included a placeholder "AI Meal Planning" section.
- **Progress (`/progress`)**: Simple overview of weight history and progress visualization.

## Key Decisions & Assumptions
- **Styling**: Used Tailwind CSS v4 (`@import "tailwindcss"`) with theme tokens in `globals.css` as requested.
- **Mock Data**: Consolidated all data in `src/lib/mock-data.ts`.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with a bottom navigation bar for mobile and a sidebar for desktop.
- **Interactivity**: Added client-side state in `WorkoutTracker` for real-time tracking during a workout.
- **State Management**: Used React `useState` and `useEffect` for the rest timer and progress tracking.

## Open Questions for Next Phase
- **Auth**: Need to integrate an authentication provider.
- **Database**: Need to define a schema and select a database to replace mock data.
- **AI Integration**: Need to determine which API to use for the AI-assisted meal planning section.
- **Deployment**: Need to select a deployment target (e.g., Vercel, AWS, etc.).

## Verification
- `npm run lint`: Passed.
- `npm run build`: Passed.

## Branch
- Work performed on branch: `feat/app-shell`.

# Handoff: Data Migration to SQLite (Prisma)

- **What Changed**:
  - Installed Prisma and set up SQLite database.
  - Defined Prisma schema matching `mock-data.ts`.
  - Created a seed script `prisma/seed.ts` to populate the DB with mock data.
  - Updated all page components (`/`, `/workouts`, `/workouts/[id]`, `/meals`, `/progress`) to fetch data from Prisma directly using Server Components.
- **Modeling Decisions**:
  - Used `Json` type for `ingredients` and `instructions` in `Meal` model to maintain flexibility in SQLite.
  - Created separate models for `Workout`, `Exercise`, `Meal`, `Progress`, and `WeightRecord` to align with the data structure.
- **Verification**:
  - Ran `npm run lint` and `npm run build` - both passed.
  - Manually verified all pages display the same data as before.
- **Note for Reviewer**:
  - Added `npx prisma migrate dev` and `npx prisma db seed` to the development workflow.
  - The database file `prisma/dev.db` is ignored in `.gitignore`.
